# Open the current url from TextMate

Whenever you're within some text in TextMate you can see the urls properly underlined. Today I finally (and accidentally) discovered how to open those urls in the browser.

The command is `⌅` and on my macbook can be reached by using together `fn` and `⏎`.

Now that I know it I can start implementing the [lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/) bundle!
